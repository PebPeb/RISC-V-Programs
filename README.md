# RISC-V Programs

In an effort to make my CPU design verification easier for my RISC-V processors. This is the 
centralized hub for all test programs for all implementations of RISC-V. Each processor will 
have standard way of configuring this repo for building test applications.

## Requirements

- Docker is suggested for building containerized compilers though is not required (Compilers can be built natively).
